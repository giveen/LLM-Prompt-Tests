# LLM-Prompt-Tests

A collection of standardized prompts designed to benchmark and evaluate the coding capabilities, logic reasoning, and creative output of Large Language Models (LLMs). These are to be one-shot tests, if your LLM cannot produce it in one shot then it needs to up its game.

## 🎯 Purpose
The goal of this repository is to track how different models (Local LLMs, GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, etc.) handle specific technical challenges. By providing a "Prompt" and comparing it against the "Expected Output," we can visualize the delta between model generations and test agent reliability.

## 🤖 The Workflow: Agent Handoff
Thes coding results are generated using a multi-agent system within [LibreChat](https://www.librechat.ai/). Instead of a single prompt, I utilize **Agent Handoffs** to separate concerns:

* **Planner Agent:** Analyzes the initial prompt, breaks down the requirements from the prompt, and creates a step-by-step execution strategy.
* **Coding Agent:** Takes the roadmap from the Planner and implements the actual  code, focusing on syntax accuracy and performance.

This "relay" ensures that the logic is vetted before a single line of code is written, significantly reducing hallucinations.

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each test is organized into its own directory to maintain a clear history of the prompt vs. the actual output.
EXAMPLE STRUCTURE
```text
/tests
  ├── bouncing-dvd-physics
  │   ├── prompt.md          # The specific prompt used for the test
  │   ├── result.py          # The code generated by the LLM
  │   └── output.mp4         # Video or screenshot showing the "Expected" result
  └── [test-name]
      ├── prompt.md
      └──
```

## 🚀 Usage
Feel free to use these prompts to test your own local models (Ollama, LM Studio, etc.) or API-based agents. 

1. Navigate to a specific test folder.
2. Copy the content of `prompt.md`.
3. Provide the prompt to your LLM.
4. Run the resulting code and compare it to the file in the output folder to verify accuracy.

## 🛠️ Contribution
If you have a prompt that consistently "breaks" models or reveals interesting architectural flaws in how AI writes code, feel free to open a Pull Request!
